# Host any port on any machine.

In this short blog post, I will explain a great trick to expose various services like Jupyter-notebook, tensorboard, etc. to the entire internet.

Before following the steps I want you to understand some fundamentals behind the hosting of different services.

### **Some Basics:**

Whenever we host some services on a local server having URLs like ([https://localhost:8888](https://localhost:8888) or [http://127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888)) they are behind a NAT or firewall of our computer(Most of the hackers work to breach these).

To jump over the firewall, we will use [ngrok](http://ngrok.com).

### Ngrok:

Ngrok allows you to expose a web server running on your local machine to the internet. Just tell ngrok what port your web server is listening on.
something like this:

### **Steps to host Jupyter-Notebook on AWS EC2:**

1. First, we need to install tmux for running processes(jupyter in our case) in background and jupyter notebook.

   ```
	sudo apt-get install tmux
   ```

   ```
	pip3 install jupyter
   ```


2. Download ngrok using

    ```
	wget [https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip](https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip)
    ```

3. Unzip to install ngrok

    ```
	unzip ngrok.zip
    ```

4. Create an account on [ngrok](http://ngrok.com) and get authtoken.

    ```
	./ngrok authtoken <your_auth_token>
    ```
5. Now on tmux we will run jupyter-notebook

    ```
	tmux
    ```
    ```
	jupyter-notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root ``` 

6. Host the noted port using ngrok. For my case it is 8890

    ```
	./ngrok http 8890
    ```

Also, you can make a config file and can host multiple ports using the same account as mentioned [here](https://ngrok.com/docs#config).

7. Now note the URL you got on ngrok screen.

8. Cheers and now hit the URL as many times as you can to access your favorite jupyter notebook.

### Conclusion:

In this cool blogpost, we understood to host jupyter notebook on the local machine. We can host other services like tensorboard or anything you want.
